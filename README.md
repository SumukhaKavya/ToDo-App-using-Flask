# ToDo-App-using-Flask

This is a simple to-do list application created using Flask. It allows users to add new tasks to a list and view all current tasks on the homepage.

## Installation

To use this application, you'll need to have Python and Flask installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website, and install Flask using the following command in your terminal:

pip install Flask

## Usage

To start the application, navigate to the directory where you've saved the files and run the following command in your terminal:

flask --app app run --debug

This will start the Flask development server and you should see a message in your terminal that says "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/". Open a web browser and go to this address, and you should see the to-do list application.

To add a new task, simply type a description into the input field on the homepage and click the "Add Task" button. The new task will be added to the list and displayed on the homepage.

## Customization

You can customize this application by adding additional features, such as the ability to mark tasks as completed, edit or delete tasks, or filter tasks by category or due date. You can also modify the HTML and CSS code to change the look and feel of the application.
